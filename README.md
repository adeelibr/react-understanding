## How to run 🌋

This repository only uses `parcel` for bundling & 2 `babel` presets namely

- @babel/preset-env: "^7.12.1"
- @babel/preset-react: "^7.12.5"

This repository has 3 chapters, in order to run each chapter all you have to do
is after cloning this repository.

- Go in your folder root directory & run `npm install` / `yarn install`
- Once the dependencies have been installed to run each chapter you can run the
command below

```code
  npm run start:chapter::1; // will run chapter 1
  npm run start:chapter::2; // will run chapter 2
  npm run start:chapter::3; // will run chapter 3
```

## Purpose 🦮

For understanding how react works internally, so hopefully one day I can commit
something important to the react code base itself.

How react works, how does it reconciliate, how do hooks works, how do they maintain
there states and everything I learn will be added to this codebase.

[This for personal learning only]
